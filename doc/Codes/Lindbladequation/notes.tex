\section{Introduction}

This note provides an extremely abridged, and perhaps overly
practical, introduction to open quantum systems. The goal is to
provide the basis for understanding and implementing an open quantum
system using the Lindblad master equation. And then hopefully link this with PMMs.

\section{Open?}

In quantum mechanics, a system is considered \emph{closed} if it is
isolated from its environment. In contrast, an \emph{open quantum
system} interacts with its environment, which can cause the system to
lose coherence and entanglement.

All this boils down to whether or not energy is conserved. In a closed
system, energy is conserved, while in an open system, energy is not
conserved.


\section{Density Matrices}

As opposed to the wavefunction (a so-called pure state) in closed
(Hermitian) quantum mechanics, the density matrix uniquely describes
the state of a quantum system in an open system, as well as in closed
systems.

With pure states, the state of a quantum system is deterministic and
leads to probabilities of outcomes of measurements. In contrast, what
if the state itself is uncertain and therefore probabilistic? This is
what density matrices describe.\footnote{A natural question might be:
“What about probabilistic mixtures of density matrices?” Luckily, such
systems are also just described by density matrices.}

The important properties are summarized here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The density matrix of a pure state $\ket{\psi}$ is $\rho = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$.
    \item $\rho$ is Hermitian, positive semi-definite (all eigenvalues non-negative), and has unit trace:
    \[
    \rho = \rho^\dagger, \quad \lambda(\rho) \ge 0, \quad \Tr(\rho) = 1.
    \]
    \item Given a probabilistic mixture of states with probabilities $\{p_i\}$ and states $\{\ket{\psi_i}\}$,
    \[
    \rho = \sum_i p_i \ket{\psi_i}\bra{\psi_i}.
    \]
    \item For a $d \times d$ density matrix $\rho$, there exists an orthonormal basis $\{\ket{b_i}\}$ such that
    \[
    \rho = \sum_i \lambda_i \ket{b_i}\bra{b_i},
    \]
    where $\lambda_i$ are probabilities.
    \item The expectation value of an observable $X$ is
    \[
    \langle X \rangle = \Tr(\rho X) = \sum_i \lambda_i \bra{b_i} X \ket{b_i}.
    \]
    \item The time evolution in a closed system with Hamiltonian $H$ is
    \[
    \rho(t) = e^{-iHt} \rho(0) e^{iHt}.
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{One Qubit Example}

The codes for these various examples are included as a separate Python code..
Consider a single qubit system that has a 50\% chance of being in
$\ket{0}$, a 25\% chance of being in $\ket{+} =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}+\ket{1})$, and a 25\% chance of being in
$\ket{-} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}-\ket{1})$. Then

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\ket{0}\bra{0} + \frac{1}{4}\ket{+}\bra{+} + \frac{1}{4}\ket{-}\bra{-} =
\begin{bmatrix}
3/4 & 0 \\[4pt]
0 & 1/4
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\subsection{Two Qubit Example}

Consider a system of two qubits that has a 90\% chance of being in the Bell state
\[
\ket{B_+} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00} + \ket{11}).
\]
The remaining 10\% is distributed among $\ket{01}$, $\ket{10}$, and $\ket{B_-} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00}-\ket{11})$ in the ratio 3:2:1. Then
\[
\rho = \frac{9}{10}\ket{B_+}\bra{B_+} + \frac{1}{20}\ket{01}\bra{01} + \frac{1}{30}\ket{10}\bra{10} + \frac{1}{60}\ket{B_-}\bra{B_-}.
\]

\section{Subsystems and Partial Traces}

An open quantum system is a subsystem of a closed system composed of system + environment. To describe only the system, we trace out the environment:
\[
\rho_A = \Tr_B(\rho).
\]
For a pure state $\ket{\psi} = \ket{a}\otimes\ket{b}$, the reduced density matrix is
\[
\rho_A = \sum_j (I_A \otimes \bra{j}) \rho (I_A \otimes \ket{j}).
\]

\subsection{Two Qubit Example}

From the two-qubit example,
\[
\rho_1 = \Tr_2(\rho) =
\begin{bmatrix}
61/120 & 0 \\[4pt]
0 & 59/120
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad
\rho_2 = \Tr_1(\rho) =
\begin{bmatrix}
59/120 & 0 \\[4pt]
0 & 61/120
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\section{von Neumann Equation}

For the total density matrix $\rho_T$ of system plus environment with total Hamiltonian $H_T$,
\[
\frac{d\rho_T}{dt} = -i[H_T, \rho_T].
\]

\section{Lindblad Master Equation}

Writing $H_T = H + H_E + H_I$, where $H$ is the system Hamiltonian, $H_E$ the environment Hamiltonian, and $H_I$ their interaction, tracing out the environment and assuming weak coupling yields:
\[
\frac{d\rho}{dt} = -i[H,\rho] + \sum_k \gamma_k \left( L_k \rho L_k^\dagger - \frac{1}{2}\{L_k^\dagger L_k, \rho\} \right),
\]
where $\rho$ is the reduced density matrix, $\gamma_k \ge 0$ are decay rates, and $L_k$ are jump operators.

The Heisenberg picture form is
\[
\frac{dX}{dt} = i[H,X] + \sum_k \gamma_k \left( L_k^\dagger X L_k - \frac{1}{2}\{L_k^\dagger L_k, X\} \right),
\]
and the identity operator satisfies $\frac{dI}{dt}=0$.

\subsection{Liouvillian Superoperator}

Define the superoperator $\mathcal{L}$ by
\[
\mathcal{L}[\rho] = -i[H,\rho] + \sum_k \gamma_k \left( L_k\rho L_k^\dagger - \frac{1}{2}\{L_k^\dagger L_k, \rho\} \right),
\]
so that
\[
\frac{d\rho}{dt} = \mathcal{L}[\rho].
\]

\subsection{Vectorization: The Fock–Liouville Space}

Define $\ket{A\!\rangle\!\rangle}$ as the column-stacked vectorization of an operator $A$. The inner product is
\[
\braket{\!\braket{A|B}} = \Tr(A^\dagger B),
\]
and
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\ket{\!\braket{\rho}} = \hat{\mathcal{L}}\ket{\!\braket{\rho}},
\]
with solution
\[
\ket{\!\braket{\rho(t)}} = e^{\hat{\mathcal{L}}t} \ket{\!\braket{\rho(0)}}.
\]
Diagonalizing $\hat{\mathcal{L}}$ gives eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ and eigenvectors $\ket{\!\braket{r_i}}$ and $\bra{\!\braket{l_i}}$, allowing
\[
\ket{\!\braket{\rho(t)}} = \sum_i e^{\lambda_i t} \braket{\!\braket{l_i|\rho(0)}} \ket{\!\braket{r_i}}.
\]

\subsection{Steady State}

The steady state $\ket{\!\braket{\rho_{\text{ss}}}}$ satisfies
\[
\hat{\mathcal{L}}\ket{\!\braket{\rho_{\text{ss}}}} = 0.
\]

\subsection{Harmonic Oscillator Coupled to a Bath}

For $H = \omega a^\dagger a$ and jump operators $L_1 = \sqrt{\gamma(\tau+1)}\,a$, $L_2 = \sqrt{\gamma\tau}\,a^\dagger$, the Lindblad equation reads:
\[
\frac{d\rho}{dt} = -i[\omega a^\dagger a, \rho] + \gamma(\tau+1)\left[a\rho a^\dagger - \frac{1}{2}\{a^\dagger a,\rho\}\right]
+ \gamma\tau\left[a^\dagger\rho a - \frac{1}{2}\{aa^\dagger,\rho\}\right].
\]
