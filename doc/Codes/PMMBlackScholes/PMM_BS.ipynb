    "This work uses Parametric Matrix Models introcuded by Cook, Jammooa, et.al in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61362-4, to solve the Black-Scholes partial differential equation. Parametric matrix models is a class of machine learning algorithms that utilize matrix equations to emulate physical systems, in contrast to the much researched neural networks that are based on the biology of neurons. \n",

    "Parametrix matrix models can learn the equations that govern a set of data, be they algebraic, integral or differential equations. This may have many applications in scientific computing. In addition, Cook, Jammo, et.al show in the paper that PMMs are universal function approximators. They also use PMMs on classical machine learning tasks such as image recognition, resulting in performance comparable to traditional methods. \n",

    "In our training method we also return all the parametrized matrices (after training is complete). This is done because I have experienced with if the model can be trained on one set of financial parameters, but still generalize to different ones. \n",
    "The main idea has been to project the parameters together with the vectors and the matrices, and then project them back to the full space. After this is done I thought to multiply the matrices with a suitable factor that corresponds to the new financial parameter. So for instance if the model is trained with $\\sigma_i = 0.2$ and then we set $\\sigma_i = 0.4$ we can multiply the previous second derivative matrices with $2$ to get the matrices to apply to this new value of $\\sigma$ as well. This effort has not been fruitful. "

    "#### Summary, thoughts and improvements \n",
    "\n",
    "In this file we have developed a PMM model to solve the Black-Scholes equation in 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 dimensions. \n",
    "The equation was succesfully solved using data generated by Monte Carlo simulations (though the number of Monte Carlo simulations is too low for accurate results in the 4D and 5D case). \n",
    "The most exciting aspect of this study has been that the PMM experiences little to no increase in error as the dimensionality of the equation increases. This is in contrast to other approaches such as the PINN model and regular finite-difference or finite-elements methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is still lots of work to be done and potential drawbacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a validation loss to find the best model, and plot both validation loss and training loss. \n",
    "2. The PMM can only predict using the same dt as during training (at least I have not found a way to predict using different dt). This may cause such a PMM model to be less generalizable compared to methods such as traditional neural networks and PINNs. \n",
    "3. As the dimensionality of the problem increased the amount of training data decreased due to the Monte-Carlo simulations being computationally heavy. One way to fix this, to obtain more training data, is to perform the Monte-Carlo simulations on high-performance computers. \n",
    "4. For the case of 4D an 5D we use too few MC simulations, 5_000. This is not enough to capture the option prices correctly, but it still shows the promise of PMMs as the PMMs are able to recreate the results of the MC simulation with great accuracy. It would also be beneficial to peform some error analysis on the MC simulation to find out exactly how 'wrong' the simulations are. \n",
    "5. The PMM model in this file can only predict using the same set of financial parameters as was used during training (the ones used for the Monte-Carlo simulation). It would be interesting to see if on could define the model to generalize to different parameters as well. One avenue of research would be to include the parameters when projecting the data to the lower-dimensional space for training. After the training we project back to the full space, and scale the parametrized matrices to match a new set of financial parameters. \n",
    "6. It is also possible to train the PMM model without specificying the financial parameters, though this leads to more unstable training. \n",
    "7. This file does not train nor predict on correlated assets. Datasets for correlated assets are included in folders. So one can simply train a model and predict using these sets. It is worth to mention that the solution space becomes more complex when the assets are correlated, so it would be interesting to see if this affeects PMM performance. \n",
    "8. The traditional neural network that was used for comparison with the PMM has not been optimized to find the best hyperparameters. The results of this network might improve with better hyperparameter configuration. \n",
    "9. It is also needed to do a more careful analysis and discussion of why the PMM performs better than the PINN model and traditional model, especially when increasing the number of dimensions. \n",
    "10. More hyperparameter configuration is needed for the PMM, such as for the size of the matrices and how this scales with the computation time, and for other hyperparameters sych as the learning rate and the scaling factor when initializing the trainable parameters. \n",
    "11. The TNN compares significantly worse in 1D compared to the other dimensions. I have not found the cause of this. In BlackScholesPINN the mean absolute error of a similar model is reduced by a factor of 10. In addition the plot showing the absolute error shows no increase in error at the kink (terminal conditiion), but it does show this in the other aforementioned file. The cause of this discrepancy is still unknown to me. \n"
